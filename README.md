## Getting Started

To contribute to ZMK Studio, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Tauri CLI](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk-studio.git
   cd zmk-studio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Building the Project

To build the project for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and bundle the application using Vite.

### Running Storybook

To develop and test UI components in isolation, you can use Storybook:

1. **Start Storybook**:

   ```sh
   npm run storybook
   ```

   This will start the Storybook server and open it in your default web browser.

2. **Build Storybook**:

   ```sh
   npm run build-storybook
   ```

   This will build the Storybook static site for deployment.

### Linting

To ensure code quality and consistency, you can run the linter:

```sh
npm run lint
```

This will run ESLint on the codebase and report any issues.

### Tauri Commands

For Tauri-specific commands, you can use:

1. **Run Tauri development server**:

   ```sh
   npm run tauri -- dev
   ```

   This will start the Tauri development server for building and testing the desktop application.

2. **Build Tauri application**:

   ```sh
   npm run tauri -- build
   ```

   This will build the Tauri desktop application for production.
